***Adventure Game Project***

**Overview**

This project involves designing and implementing an adventure game where players navigate through various locations. The game's foundation is flexible, allowing for creative scenarios such as a treasure-hunting pirate, a plumber in a labyrinth of pipes, or a knight in a medieval castle.

**Starting Point**

The project is based on the "Adventure World" game template, available for download. This template includes three Python class files that form the game's core, which you can adapt as needed.

**Development Approach**

The focus is on applying sound software engineering principles like low coupling, high cohesion, and responsibility-driven design. Code duplication is minimized, and the design promotes clean, maintainable code.

**Enhanced Features**

To increase complexity, features like item interactions, vertical movement, and instant teleportation can be added. The emphasis, however, remains on clean design and documentation, adhering to best practices in software engineering.

**Project Goal**

The primary goal is to create a well-structured and documented adventure game, demonstrating proficiency in both game design and software engineering principles.
